> Subcontracting means entering into an agreement with another business to carry out specific work that is required under a contract that you have with your customer. Subcontracting of services is often called outsourcing. Subcontractors are usually hired because a project needs additional manpower or specialist expertise. This cost will be an addition to the final product cost.
